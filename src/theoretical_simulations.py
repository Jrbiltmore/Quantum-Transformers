# Unified Theory Simulation Use Case
# This module contains simulations based on the unified set of equations for integrating various domains of theoretical physics.

# Equation examples:
# 1. Unified Energy-Momentum Tensor
# T_{\mu
u} = T_{\mu
u}^{{standard}} + T_{\mu
u}^{{dark}}

# 2. Quantum Gravity with Extra Dimensions
# G_{\mu
u} + \Lambda g_{\mu
u} = \frac{{8\pi G}}{{c^4}}T_{\mu\nu}

# ... and so on for other equations.

# These equations will be used to simulate different aspects of theoretical physics,
# incorporating quantum computing concepts where applicable.
